<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an university student studying a Bachelor of Software Engineering. I chose this field as I have a bit of 
  experience with coding in high school. Moreover, women are supported and widely desired in the STEM community, 
  giving many opportunities to them. In technology, there are many aspects one can choose from, making every day
  different from the last. Additionally, I am taking part in GradGirls from Women4STEM which is a program where
  girls get the privilege to part take in various sponsored events to widen their network and take thier initial
  steps in the STEM world. On top of that, I am completing two courses on Udemy which will help me sharpen my 
  coding skills. I am someone who enjoys keeping up with the trends and am a fast learner. I hope to open my own
  firm one day.

  If we dive a bit deeper, I am a kind of person who will do anything for their loved ones, if it is morally and 
  ethically correct. I value honesty and expect the same from the people around me. I am a confident and outgoing
  person, who enjoys meeting new people and will not be afraid when a new challenge arises. My hobbies include
  dancing, reading, listening to music and travelling the world. I really want to get more involved into my hobbies,
  but also find a job in my field currently.

  My goals as an individual is to live a healthy life, which will come about when I eat good and work out. Moreover, 
  have financial freedom where I don't have to think twice for a reasonable spend and am able to give back to my
  parents where they have a stress free life. I am truly thankful to them for raising me and doing everything in their
  power to make me into the strong woman I am today. Credits to them! Can't forget about my brother, I want that 
  brotherly-sisterly love (which we have) to develop into something where we can trust each other and rely on each other.
  I want a beautiful life for my family where I can support my husband and kids and go through this adventure together.
